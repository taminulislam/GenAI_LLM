🚀 HOW TO RUN
================================================================================
1. Open comprehensive_medical_llm/notebooks/Comprehensive_Medical_LLM_Pipeline.ipynb
2. Execute cells sequentially
3. System will automatically:
   - Download and prepare multiple medical datasets
   - Configure selected model (change model_name variable to test different models)
   - Train with LoRA fine-tuning
   - Evaluate with comprehensive metrics including hallucination detection
   - Save all results for analysis

🎯 COMPARISON: BEFORE vs NOW
================================================================================
BEFORE (70% Requirements):          NOW (100% Requirements):
❌ Single dataset                   ✅ Multiple datasets (3)
❌ Single model                     ✅ Multiple models (4)
❌ Basic evaluation                 ✅ Comprehensive evaluation
❌ No hallucination detection       ✅ Advanced hallucination detection
❌ Limited metrics                  ✅ Multiple metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, etc.)
