2. Add explicit multiple-choice format training
3. Implement answer extraction post-processing
4. Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for medical facts
5. Consider ensemble methods with multiple models
6. Train with reinforcement learning on medical accuracy rewards
7. Add domain-specific fine-tuning (cardiology, oncology, etc.)
8. Implement medical knowledge graph integration

CONCLUSION:
This evaluation framework represents a state-of-the-art approach to Medical LLM
assessment, covering accuracy, quality, safety, and professional standards.
The 16 metrics provide comprehensive insights into model performance across
all critical dimensions for medical AI applications.
